    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>
      chatBuck is a social networking app built using Ruby on Rails. It's free &amp; completely open source. You can check the source on <a href="#"> Github</a>. Also take a look at the demo deployed to <a href="#">Heroku</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
      I am not building the next Facebook. Given that there are enough social networks already I don't want to end up launching one. Pointless! So why am I building? I want to try and learn how to develop a social network and in the process show you how easy it is done using Rails. Here is the <a href="#">Blog post</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>
      As stated above it's a Ruby on Rails application. Frontend is developed using Twitter Bootstrap. Database is Postgresql  for development and  production.
